# Supervised-learning

###Regression
Given training input examples and their desired outputs, the aim is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Once learned, the rule can be deployed on test data.

>**outputs = continuous values**

###Classification
Given training input examples and their desired outputs, the aim is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Once learned, the rule can be deployed on test data.

>**outputs = discrete values (labels)**

# Unsupervised Learning: 

###Clustering
Discover groups (clusters) of similar examples within the data sample so that different clusters contain the most dissimilar instances

>**outputs = not given**


###Density estimation
Estimate the distribution of data within the input space to deduce the statistical parameters of the true density function

>**outputs = not given**


###Dimensionality reduction
Project the data from a high-dimensional space to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization or discovering its latent structure.
